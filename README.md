## Introduction
The inevitable task of a SysOps engineer in an organization is creating user accounts and groups. For a small organization, this can be easy to perform manually. For large organizations however, this can prove to be a daunting task. More so, it would be error prone. This challenge can be taken off by automating the process using bash scripts.

This article gives a step-by-step guide on how to automate the process of user and group creation using Bash script.

### Creating Functions
